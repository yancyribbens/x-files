    I've been working on Weerust recently which is IRC client developed using the Rust programing language.  A problem recently prevented WeeRust from forwarding the message to me over IMAP because of a temporary network hiccup.  Reviewing the code I found an oversight where the <i>send_email()</i> returns an <i>Option&lt;u32&gt;</i> when instead it should return <i>Result&lt;(), AppErr&gt;</i> because <i> send_email() </i> can fail.  I would like to handle that falure gracefully instead of panic which is what happened the other night crashing my client and disconnecting me from the IRC network.  I added a question mark operator to the <i>send_email()</i> method <a href="https://github.com/yancyribbens/weerust/commit/7e8c66a0ec26691b900b0b2bc769ab8392841728#diff-e574a8b5cb145a5a0d3829cd5290a736d64938f8b1af48de1d1686e7e319c123R81"> here </a> (more details about the question mark here <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html"> here </a>.  The question mark operator combined with the signature change will now match either <i>Ok(t)</i> or <i>Err(e)</i>, and if the match is an <i>Err</i>, then the function will immediatly return <i>Err(e.into()) </i>(more on how into() works later).  From here there's a few options; we can create a re-try strategy, hold the message in a buffer until it can be viewed later, inform the sender the message can't be delieved or some combination.  Since this application is very much a WIP I decided to just inform the sender the message can't be forwarded for the time being.

    <p>
      The other change this required is adding a new option to the enum:

      <pre>
        SmtpError(lettre::transport::smtp::Error)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we need to add a new trait <i>From&lt;T&gt;</i> to the enum.  This new From trait does a value-to-value conversion.  In our case, it converts:

    <pre>
      SmtpError(lettre::transport::smtp::Error)
    </pre>

    <p>
      To:
    </p>

    <pre>
      AppErr::SmtpError(error)
    </pre>

    <p>
      Here is the the trait definition looks:
    </p>

    <pre>
      impl From<lettre::transport::smtp::Error> for AppErr {
        fn from(error: lettre::transport::smtp::Error) -> Self {
          AppErr::SmtpError(error)
        }
      }
    </pre>

    <p>
      So now our new question mark operator can return something that is <i>AppErr::..</i> even though the original error was a different type.  Wrapping a error in a common type while still maintaining the original context information which can be useful for debugging.  This is a common pattern for designing error propogation in Rust as described <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html#examples"> here </a>.
